        <h1>Warmer Colder</h1>
        

        <p class="about">Extremely simple Minimum Viable Product game based around your location that requires 2 players. Player 1 will go to a position and press the button. Player 1 will then hand the phone to Player 2. Player 2 will try to guess the first location by clicking the button. If Player 2 is closer than the previous guess, the button will say 'warmer'. If Player 2 is farther away than the previous guess, the button will say 'colder'. Player 2 wins when a guess is made within 6 feet of the location Player 1 chose.</p>
