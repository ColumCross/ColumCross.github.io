        <h2>Warmer Colder</h2>
        <p>Extremely simple Minimum Viable Product game based around your location that requires 2 players. Player 1 will go to a position and press the button. Player 1 will then hand the phone to Player 2. Player 2 will try to guess the first location by clicking the button. If Player 2 is closer than the previous guess, the button will say 'warmer'. If Player 2 is farther away than the previous guess, the button will say 'colder'. Player 2 wins when a guess is made within 6 feet of the location Player 1 chose.</p>

        <h2>#mywakingview</h2>
        <p>When I was in England I saw an art exhibit where a guy stamped and mailed a postcard with the time he woke up everyday. So, taking inspiration from that, and a couple of other things, for a full year I took a picture of what I saw out my window when I woke up, with the date, time, and location.</p>

        <h2>Math Based N-Back Test</h2>
        <p>A math based version of an N-Back test of Working Memory. In this version, participants answer simple, single digit math problems.</p>
        <p>The N-Back Test is a test of Working Memory. Participants will be presented with and answer a series of simple, single digit math questions. The twist is, the question the participant answers is not the same as the question currently on screen. The question they will answer is the question N before the question on the screen.</p>

        <h2>Prototyping and Usability Project</h2>
        <p>I plan on redesigning WhatsApp for feature phones. Personal research in Rwanda has shown that the amount of people who use feature phones still is not negligible. The research has also shown that nearly everyone with a smartphone uses WhatsApp to communicate. For people with feature phones, the inability to use WhatsApp can be a problem. I will redesign the entirety of WhatsApp to work on very small non-touch devices. I will be basing my redesign off the Android version of WhatsApp.</p>

        <h2>Web &amp; Mobile II Project</h2>
        <p>The Spring of my freshman year I took my second Web Development class. My HTML and PHP skills were greatly increased during this semester. The individual project was meant to showcase this. The task was to build a website about a place you like to visit. The place I chose was my cottage in the 1000 Islands. This place has a lot of meaning to me because it has been in my family for generations.</p>
