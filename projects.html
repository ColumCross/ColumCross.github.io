        <h2>#mywakingview</h2>
        <p>When I was in England I saw an art exhibit where a guy stamped and mailed a postcard with the time he woke up everyday. So, taking inspiration from that, and a couple of other things, for a full year I took a picture of what I saw out my window when I woke up, with the date, time, and location.</p>

        <h2>Math Based N-Back Test</h2>
        <p>A math based version of an N-Back test of Working Memory. In this version, participants answer simple, single digit math problems.</p>
        <p>The N-Back Test is a test of Working Memory. Participants will be presented with and answer a series of simple, single digit math questions. The twist is, the question the participant answers is not the same as the question currently on screen. The question they will answer is the question N before the question on the screen.</p>

        <h2>Permission Granted</h2>
        <p>Permission Granted is built for videographers, vloggers, and anyone who regularly uses release forms. The purpose of Permission Granted is to allow people quick and easy access to their release and consent forms when filming people. Permission Granted will allow you to create and sign release and consent forms.</p>

        <h2>Prototyping and Usability Project</h2>
        <p>I plan on redesigning WhatsApp for feature phones. Personal research in Rwanda has shown that the amount of people who use feature phones still is not negligible. The research has also shown that nearly everyone with a smartphone uses WhatsApp to communicate. For people with feature phones, the inability to use WhatsApp can be a problem. I will redesign the entirety of WhatsApp to work on very small non-touch devices. I will be basing my redesign off the Android version of WhatsApp.</p>

        <h2>Client-Side Development Project</h2>
        <p>Project for my Client-Side Programming Class. I was tasked with building a dynamic dropdown menu in vanilla JavaScript. It also had to be compatible with many browsers.</p>

        <h2>Web &amp; Mobile II Project</h2>
        <p>The Spring of my freshman year I took my second Web Development class. My HTML and PHP skills were greatly increased during this semester. The individual project was meant to showcase this. The task was to build a website about a place you like to visit. The place I chose was my cottage in the 1000 Islands. This place has a lot of meaning to me because it has been in my family for generations.</p>

        <h2>Web &amp; Mobile I Project</h2>
        <p>My first structured experience in building a web site. I decided to build a site about the video game series "Assassin's Creed."</p>
